          <h1 id="abouttitle">About Our History</h1>
            <p id="autext">The history of Indian food and especially of Indian appetizers is closely 
                        related to the country’s culture and traditions. The Indian cuisine is as diverse as 
                        the Indian people and it has a large (and extremely rich) selection of appetizers, 
                        hors d'oeuvres, and snacks. Besides being extremely tasty and actually stimulating 
                        your appetite rather than diminishing it like some other cuisines’ appetizers, these 
                        fast snacks are also quite low in fat, since they are based on a number of spices and 
                        herbs, such as ginger, cinnamon, garlic, cloves, asafetida, aniseed or coriander, rather 
                        that the fat appetizers you’ll find mostly anywhere else in the World.
            </p>
            <p id="autext1">The majority of Indian appetizers and snacks are based on potatoes, combined 
                        with different spices. The Alu Ki Tikki for example, which is one of the oldest snacks 
                        recorded by the history of Indian food, is made out of mashed potatoes coriander and 
                        onions. Another snack greatly enjoyed by the British during the Raj period, the Samosa 
                        appetizer, made out of steamed potatoes, peas and vegetables, is one of the many Indian 
                        recipes that was passed on from ancient times.

          <h2>1999</h2>
            <p>Mumbai's Finest initially opened as takeway shop that was located in Beckenham and classed as a 
              small bussiness that turned into the most busy takeaway shop in town. This resulted in an investment
              of new staff and new delivery drivers.
