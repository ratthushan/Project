Development of Website:
Mumbai Finest is website targeted at primarily at customers who order or dine in for food. The concept of the website is to be able to allow users see the different aspects Mumbai’s Finest offers. The website itself has been spilt in five different webpages. Firstly, I started off creating the index.html page and starting with adding a banner however, after researching on other restaurant website I came across a range different ways a banner used and therefore, opted to have the index.html page as full screen banner, along with that I then added text and logo and a partnership video. In the about us page I wanted the users to a have a understanding about the history of Mumbai’s Finest, therefore, I decided to create a timeline that reflected the history. This part of the website is more of text based web page. 
Thirdly, I created the  menu page, I created a menu layout using a container and added the menu within that container. At the bottom of the webpage I added an image with hover over effect, inline with the images I have included different vouchers users are able to use when they visit the restaurant. Fourthly I created a gallery page within this gallery page there was a range of different images which allowed to explore the different food we offer at the restaurant visually. If the images are clicked it then open the image into a full screen version. Finally in the contact webpage I created a table that displayed the opening times and a section to be able to book a table. Within this section I included a sitemap and a calendar to allow users to book a table.

Issues Faced:
The development of the website was very changeling. Initial ideas had to be altered during implementation phases as when the website was coming together some of the features didn’t make fulfil it the image I had planned. For instance, I had initially planned to implement a side navigation menu, however the side menu icon contradicted as it blended within the banner images, therefore, the usability of the menu was really complex as some users would have not noticed it and thought it might have been a apart of the picture. Another issue raised was the background, initially I had planned to have the background as an image however, after adding the other features to the website, the background image had too much going on therefore, I resulted into using a plain colour background as it makes the text easier to read.
