        <h2 id="subtitle">Audi S3 </h2>
        
        <p id ="subtext" >
                The Audi S3 is a small, premium performance car that goes up against the likes of the Volkswagen Golf R, 
                BMW M135i and Ford Focus RS. It’s available as a three or five-door hatch, four-door saloon or even as a 
                convertible

        </p>

        <p id ="subtext" >
                No matter which body style you go for, you get the same 306bhp four-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine, 
                and that drives all four wheels. A six-speed manual gearbox is standard, but there is also the option of 
                a six-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox.

        </p>

        <p id ="subtext" >
            As you would expect from placing such a powerful engine in a relatively small car, performance is explosive; 
            the auto hatch is capable of 0-62mph in less than five seconds, with the manual not much slower. Top speed is 
            limited to 155mph should you have access to a runway or an unrestricted autobahn.

        </p>

        <p id ="subtext" >
                Thanks to the quattro four-wheel drive system, the S3 is able to deploy all of its power, come rain or shine. 
                The handling is precise and very secure but it isn’t quite as exciting as the Golf R, and certainly not as much 
                fun as the Ford Focus RS.
                
                

        </p>

        <p id ="subtext" >
                The Audi fights back with an interior that feels a cut above its rivals thanks to high quality materials and excellent 
                design. The five-door Sportback and saloon models also offer enough room to get a couple of six-foot adults in the back 
                without too much issue.

        </p>

        <h2 id="subtitle">Audi S5 Car Rating </h2>
        
        <p id ="subtext" >
                A five-door version of the Audi S5 Coupé, for exactly the same £47,000 price tag, and what’s not to like 
                about that? Well, not a lot, it turns out.
        </p>

        <p id ="subtext" >
                While the Audi S5 Sportback uses exactly the same 349bhp, turbocharged 3.0 V6, 8-spd Tiptronic and permanent 
                quattro four-wheel drive setup as the coupé, it does have a 6cm longer wheelbase, so there is a bit more to 
                it than 'just' the extra doors.

        </p>

        <p id ="subtext" >
                That added length has allowed for a decent sized boot beneath the useful hatchback opening (rather than the 
                booted opening of the S5 Coupé) and you also get a three-person rear bench rather than the Coupé’s strictly
                two-seater job. 
        </p>

        <p id ="subtext" >
                Discreet yet rampant in the way it gets up the road. Stick it in Dynamic and you get the piped-in engine noise 
                to make it more obvious just how much speed you’re gaining - and it’ll be a lot, given the voracious way the V6 
                spins through to its redline. But even then, the S5 feels definitively and unashamedly more fast, luxury GT rather 
                than sports car.

        </p>
        <p id ="subtext" >
                The same can be said of its handling. Our car came on standard 19in alloys but with £900 adaptive dampers, which are 
                well worth adding. Even over quite severely roughed-up British B-roads, our S5 smoothed out the niggly stuff, leaving 
                you with a bit of heaving over long wave bumps but otherwise a composed and unflustered ride. Needless to say, lope out 
                onto the motorway and you’ll be relaxing all the way to the boardroom, given that refinement and directional stability
                 are as excellent as you'd expect but for some slightly thrummy tyre noise in the background.

        </p>

        <h2 id="bmwtitle">Audi S7 </h2>
        
        <p id ="bmwtext" >
            The BMW M6 is a super fast rear-wheel drive coupe based on the stylish 6 Series, and sits at the top 
            of BMW’s performance car tree. It features a 560bhp, 4.4-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine and is 
            capable of 0-62mph in just 4.2 seconds. However, in truth it feels even faster, with plenty of power 
            for overtaking at any speed. As you'd imagine, it's an accomplished motorway cruiser.
        </p>

        <p id ="bmwtext" >
            If that's not enough, buyers can reduce that 0-62mph time to just 3.9 seconds by choosing the optional 
            M6 Competition Package. Should you want to go faster than the standard car's 155mph, another option, the 
            M Driver's Package raises the electronic speed limit to 189mph.

        </p>

        <p id ="bmwtext" >
            The M6 is distinguishable from the standard coupe by its large alloy wheels, aggressive bodykit and flared 
            wheel arches, while at the rear it gets unique M6 badging and quad exhausts. Inside, top-notch BMW build 
            quality is present throughout.

        </p>

        <p id ="bmwtext" >
            In a straight line, the BMW M6 is devastatingly fast. On paper, the 4.4-litre V8 petrol engine develops 
            560bhp and propels the car from 0-62mph in a not-inconsiderable 3.9 seconds, but in reality it feels even 
            faster. The huge amounts of power allow the BMW to keep accelerating well past 100mph, while the immediate 
            gear changes from the seven-speed automatic give instant thrust, no matter what gear you’re in.

        </p>

        <p id ="bmwtext" >
            The M Driver's Package removes the 155mph speed limiter, raising the top speed to 189mph. The Competition package 
            adds uprated suspension, dampers and anti-roll bars to further stiffen the car. It makes an arguably minor difference 
            on the road, though, but the M6 still remains comfortable at high speeds.
